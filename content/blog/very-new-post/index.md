It's a long time since I've been trying to start a blog. I designed my blog several times and started developing it. But, just like other side project it the idea never saw the light.

I beleive `now` is the best time to start anything great. That's why I'm writing this post. I'll just mention how I'm developing my blog/portfolio site.

I've designed a basic UI (I took Max Stoiber's website as inspiration and almost copied it) using the great UI design tool Figma. It's really a pleasing experience to design UI in Figma and I recommend you too (if you haven't tried yet).

Last but not least, I use `Boostnote` for my day to day note taking and writing. It's really a great note taking tool for programmer.
